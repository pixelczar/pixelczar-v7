# Videos Directory

Place your video files (MP4, WebM, etc.) in this directory.

## Usage in Sanity

When adding a video block to a case study in Sanity:

1. **For static files** (files in this directory):
   - Use the "Video URL" field
   - Enter the path starting with `/videos/`
   - Example: `/videos/my-case-study-video.mp4`

2. **For uploaded files** (hosted by Sanity):
   - Use the "Video File (Upload)" field
   - Upload directly to Sanity

## File Naming

Use descriptive, kebab-case names:
- ✅ `catalant-dashboard-demo.mp4`
- ✅ `insightsquared-user-flow.mp4`
- ❌ `video1.mp4`
- ❌ `My Video File.mp4`

## File Size

Keep videos optimized (3-5MB recommended for web). Consider:
- Compressing videos before adding
- Using modern formats (MP4 with H.264)
- Limiting resolution to 1920x1080 or lower for web
